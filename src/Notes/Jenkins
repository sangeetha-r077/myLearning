What is Jenkins?
"The leading open source automation server, Jenkins provides
hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and
automating any project." - https://jenkins.io/

CI : A software development practice where contributors are integrating their work very frequently. This results
     in multiple daily integrations to a mainline. Automated testing (post-commit promotion) is commonly used.

Continuous Delivery : A software development discipline where software is built so that it CAN be released to production at any time.

Continuous Deployment : A software development discipline where software is released continuously as part of an automated pipeline.

 CD vs CI
 Continuous Delivery is the ability to release at any time.
 Continuous Integration is just the practice of integrating code continuously. It doesn't necessarily
     mean that it can or will be released at any time.
