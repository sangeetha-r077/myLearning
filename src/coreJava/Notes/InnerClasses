Java inner class or nested class is a class which is declared inside the class or interface.
We use inner classes to logically group classes and interfaces in one place so that it can be more readable and maintainable
All the private data members and methods can be accessed.

Two types of the nested class :
Non-static nested class (inner class)
    Member inner class : A class created within class and outside method.
    Anonymous inner class :A class created for implementing interface or extending class. Its name is decided by the java compiler
    Local inner class : A class created within method.
Static nested class : A static class created within class.

A class that have no name is known as anonymous inner class in java. It should be used if you have to override method of class or interface.
Java Anonymous inner class can be created by two ways:
1)Class (may be abstract or concrete).
2)Interface.

A static class i.e. created inside a class is called static nested class in java.
It cannot access non-static data members and methods. It can be accessed by outer class name.
It can access static data members of outer class including private.
Static nested class cannot access non-static (instance) data member or method.

An interface i.e. declared within another interface or class is known as nested interface are static implicitly.
