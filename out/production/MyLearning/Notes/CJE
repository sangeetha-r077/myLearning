Jenkins is known for being easy to use and highly adaptable. There are thousands of customizations and
plugins that make Jenkins suitable for most use cases. It also works in the most common OS environments
and is relatively lightweight.

harmony. CI/CD is a common strategy used, but DevOps encompasses much more.

Continuous Integration
A software development practice where contributors are integrating their work very frequently. This results
in multiple daily integrations to a mainline. Automated testing (post-commit promotion) is commonly used.

Continuous Delivery
A software development discipline where software is built so that it CAN be released to production at any
