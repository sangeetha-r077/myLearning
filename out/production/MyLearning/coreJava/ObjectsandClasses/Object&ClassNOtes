Constructor in java is a special type of method that is used to initialize the object.

Constructor name must be same as its class name
Constructor must have no explicit return type.

If there is no constructor in a class, compiler automatically creates a default constructor.
Default constructor provides the default values to the object like 0, null etc. depending on the type.

Two types of constructors : Default constructor (no-arg constructor) : A constructor that have no parameter is known as default constructor
                            Parameterized constructor : Parameterized constructor is used to provide different values to the distinct objects

Constructor overloading : depending the parameter list in Java Class.

Constructor can perform the initialization as well as the object creations, Starting the thread, any performs any other actions as the any methods does.

Constructors can we used for copying the values as C++ by
    i)  By constructor
    ii) By assigning the values of one object into another
    ii) By clone() method of Object class

3 Ways to initialize (Initializing object simply means storing data into object) object : " By reference variable, By method, By constructor "

Anonymous simply means nameless. An object which has no reference is known as anonymous object. It can be used at the time of object creation only.

Different ways to create a object :
By new keyword
By newInstance() method
By clone() method
By deserialization
By factory method etc
